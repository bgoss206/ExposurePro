There are lot of things that you can do on top of this application.

1. [Extended Firebase Authentication Providers](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start#next_steps) : Use other authentication flows besides email/password.
2. [React Redux](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start#next_steps) : Use more complex application states for authentication and other data.
3. [Style with CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp) : Of course, make the project look better with CSS styling!

# About HackPacks ðŸŒ²

HackPacks are built by the [TreeHacks](https://www.treehacks.com/) team and contributors to help hackers build great projects at our hackathon that happens every February at Stanford. We believe that everyone of every skill level can learn to make awesome things, and this is one way we help facilitate hacker culture. We open source our hackpacks (along with our internal tech) so everyone can learn from and use them! Feel free to use these at your own hackathons, workshops, and anything else that promotes building :)

If you're interested in attending TreeHacks, you can apply on our [website](https://www.treehacks.com/) during the application period.

You can follow us here on [GitHub](https://github.com/treehacks) to see all the open source work we do (we love issues, contributions, and feedback of any kind!), and on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/treehacks), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hackwithtrees), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/hackwithtrees) to see general updates from TreeHacks.
